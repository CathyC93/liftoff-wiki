You need to grade your student's Online Profiles before class.

No assignments are assigned this week, but next week will be the Live Coding assignment.

# Weekly Reminders

Make sure your students are making commits on their projects. If students are blocked make sure they are communicating that to their group mates, don't be afraid to pair students on a problem if progress isn't being made.
