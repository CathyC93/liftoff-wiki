## Technical Interviews
Talk to your group about your experience with technical interviews. A few students may have already gone on interviews with companies, so feel free to let them also share their experiences. What went well? What do you wish someone had told you? What went poorly? Telling the story of your technical interview experience will help students gauge their expectations and readiness.

It may be helpful to tie this to how intimately students should understand their projects and the technologies they've used in them so far. What should students know before stepping into an interview? What are some current industry trends you think it's important that they familiarize themselves with a bit before talking to companies? 

## Rest of Class
If you have students who haven't passed Live Coding, please direct them to try again either with you, the course manager, or the instructor. Remind them that they cannot pass Liftoff without passing live coding.

There should be a significant amount of work time available for your students so direct them to work on the group project after your conversation.

# Objectives
* Give students insight on the technical interview
* Work towards completing the project

# Next Week

Students should be getting user stories out of the way and should keep working towards completing their projects.

# Weekly Reminders

Remind students to keep working towards user stories. Your workflow should be fairly fluid by now; let the course manager know if you're running into troubles.
