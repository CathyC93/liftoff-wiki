## Project Reviews
You probably already have an idea of where the group's progress is at. The group will pass the project review with an MVP of their app. User stories should be completed, if your group has already completed, talk to them about possibly deploying their app. Do you have any advice to them for deploying?

Encourage your students to continue learning and building things on their own. What do you think are good resources for doing so? How do you think they should pursue continued self education?


# Objectives
* Students complete final project review and course
* Every student should have worked on at 2 user stories during the project cycle.
* Every student in your group should have turned in a resume, online Profile, and 2 project check ins.


# Weekly Reminders

If you have any students who still need to complete Live Coding or Mock Interviews, please direct to try once more with you, the instructor, or the course manager. If they do not pass, they will have to complete these things with the course manager in the following weeks to transition to the apprenticeship program.
