# Class Tips & Tricks
## Online Profiles
Direct students to complete the LaunchCode Branded resume template. Remind them not to change the template! Also remind them to paste with destination formatting (probably shift + paste)!

LinkedIn profiles are great networking tools so talk to students about how LinkedIn can be used to generally make more connections and learn about things. Remind them that a LinkedIn profile is helpful in your future job search. People can sometimes find mentors via LinkedIn so hintiddy-hint-hint.  

## Progress

At this point, you should have your project planning out of the way and have started or should start to actually write code for your project. 

# Objectives
* Complete a resume and LinkedIn Profile
* Complete Project planning
* Start writing code for projects

# Next Week

Really push students to start getting code out, if they haven't they should! The first project review is next class and they'll need to have something running.

# Weekly Reminders

Work towards implementing user stories in code. Get working to complete something viable to pass the project review next week.
