Welcome to the Liftoff Mentor Playbook.

This will serve as a guide to you as a Mentor throughout this program. Each week will be broken down with the topics, assignments that need to be graded, and various other pieces of information you may find beneficial as you serve as a Mentor to the students of this program.

As you work through this program as a mentor, please add to this Playbook so that it becomes even more useful to future classes and mentors!

Thanks for participating in this class.
