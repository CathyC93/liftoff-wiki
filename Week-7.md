## Mock Interviews
Today students will have to complete their mock interview (practice interview) with either you, the course manager, the instructor, or a volunteer. Remind them to frame their answers as stories and don't forget the STAR method (it's in their prep work).

## Rest of Class
Students should continue working towards completing their projects. If you have students who have still not yet completed Live Coding, please take some time to run them through Live Coding.
