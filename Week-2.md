## Minimum Viable Product
It's important to communicate with students the importance of working on actionable points. Many students will have lots of ambition or just have some nebulous ideas on what features they want to build. Communicate with them that they want to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) rather than the most robust thing ever.

The key piece of this conversation is not to minimize the project per se, but thinking about how to most simply implement user stories and features so that they still deliver on the base functionality you're looking for. Remind students that they only have 8 weeks, they don't have to reinvent the wheel with their features and that they shouldn't.

## Wireframing

When wireframing, remind students that they don't want to be meticulously detailed. The idea here is to get a sense of how your project will be laid out. Have students work together on wireframes, it is a group project, make sure they're working towards a shared vision



# Objectives
* Finalize the MVP of your group project and what you want the final project to look like
* Build out some wireframes
* Get working on user stories

# Next Week

Keep encouraging your students to work on developing user stories, next class we'll work on some career modules. 

# Weekly Reminders

Keep working towards completing user stories (primarily creating them at this point), and use wireframes to inform those user stories.
