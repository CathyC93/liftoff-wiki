Live Coding

# Assignments
# Due
Initial project reviews are due (students should have a running project and completed user story)
# In Class
The course manager, instructor, volunteers, and you will facilitate live coding interviews for students. If a student passes, instruct them to work towards completing more user stories. If a student fails, talk them through potential ways to improve (You'll find more of that in the Tips & Tricks section).

# Class Tips & Tricks

# Live Coding
Before your students go out to do their live coding interviews, remind them to take their time to ask clarifying questions, break down the problem, and use techniques like pseudocoding or test cases before jumping into code. You should have some time to talk to them about experiences you've had in technical interviews. How did you feel? How did you do? What were techniques that helped prepare you? These are all things they'd love to hear! Talking to students about a story of failure (if you have one), and how you overcame that can also help them understand that it is a process that they don't necessarily need to ace the first time. 

Students will still struggle with syntax and breaking down problems. A good way to prepare them for this is to get them in the habit of asking clarifying questions. Remind students that they cannot answer a question that they don't understand and that it's okay to ask questions (they'll either get answered or not)! If students don't pass, it may be helpful to pair a few together and work on an example.

As you are facilitating an interview, remember to answer clarifying questions rather than an "is this correct?" type question. If you see students moving towards an incorrect solution, it's okay to prompt them to rethink their logic or even for you to ask them to talk you through their logic (they may catch where they're off).


# Next Week
If students haven't passed live coding remind them to practice problems on sites like hackerrank, leetcode, or codewars. They will have a chance to make up their live coding grade either with you, the course manager, or the instructor. Students should keep working towards completing user stories.

# Weekly Reminders
Remind students to commit their work regularly as they complete user stories (each student in your group should have completed at least a user story by now). Also, remind them to keep working towards user stories. Again, as it's a group project, it's a great idea to pair students together to work towards user stories.
